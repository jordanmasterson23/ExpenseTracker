# Expense Tracker
###By: Jordan Masterson

---

This is a simple Expense Tracking program, written in Python using the SQLite3 library, that runs in a terminal

###What does this program do?
This program allows you to budget your money into accounts (bills you need to pay) and lets you keep track of how much money you have left to spend

You can add income, make a withdrawal or transfer money between accounts.

Each transaction logs the amount, the payee, type of transaction (ex. groceries, bill, transer, deposit, etc) and the date

###Future plans:
* View all transactions in an account
* Sort data by type of transaction to see where you can cut spending
* Web App GUI (original purpose of this project.  Already in the works)
